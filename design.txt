So I want to be able to open multiple video windows, representing the view of several different cameras with different sensors
each one will represent the ground truth image happening in some system, static to start but with the option to view a time-dependent sample.

The static scene will be a few blobs, or maybe a resolution target of some sort?  

so there will be a single ground truth image object, that has the real data in there?
    - there will be a high-res matrix of the image data, oversampled compared to the max res by some factor (4-6x?)
    - each matrix cell has the # of photons/sec in there

and there's a single clock that runs, and send a timestep to each sensor that might trigger an update

each camera has a set
    - framerate
    - exposure time
    - quantum efficiency
    - read noise
    - dark noise

How will i handle EM gain(?)

so to generate an image, each camera object will peek at the data in the image object, bin as needed, and then multiply by it's exposure time.

So what's the first task?
- make a class Camera that has height, width, pixel size, noise 
- make an Image class that has data to use... maybe gaussian
